**Case Study reading:**  
[The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/right-to-be-exception/release/2)
---
Summary:

1.) What is a data-driven rule, and what does it mean to be a data-driven exception? Is
an exception the same as an error?

2.) In addition to those listed above, what other factors differentiate data-driven decisions
from human ones?

3.) Beyond what is discussed above, what are some of the benefits and downsides of indi-
vidualization?

4.) Why is uncertainty so critical to the right to be an exception? When the stakes are
high (e.g., in criminal sentencing), is there any evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy) that
can justify the use of a data-driven rule without the consideration of uncertainty?
