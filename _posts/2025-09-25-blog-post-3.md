The Unnerving Future of A.I.-Fueled Video Games: Rebuttal
---

Premise 1: The use of A.I. by Big game companies will make developers obsolete.
Premise 2: There are concerns that A.I. powered NPC’s are gaining sentience and becoming self aware.
Premise 3: A.I. can be used to do menial, repetitive, and time consuming tasks, to reduce development time and make producing games cheaper.
Conclusion: The use of A.I. in video games raises a lot of ethical concerns .

P1 Challenge: This argument relies on the Slipper Slope Fallacy. While A.I. can be used to outsource jobs such as level design, dialogue writing, and voice acting. A.I. will not be able to fully replace developers, as developers will be needed to keep watch of A.I. and make sure they are producing the intended results.
P2 Challenge: A.I. seems to have a human-like awareness, it is simply a program programmed to imitate people. The same way that the ghosts in Pac-Man are not alive but simply algorithm’s, NPC’s powered by A.I. are just astronomically more complex algorithms.
P3 Challenge: It is true that A.I. can be used as a means of saving on development time by doing the tasks that take developers many many hours, but the costs of using A.I. in video games, especially for Real-time dialogue writing can cost thousands of dollars daily while in operation.
R: A.I. still has a long way to go before being used widespread in the gaming industry, and hopefully before then it can be regulated. 

C2: A.I.  should be used sparingly when in the gaming industry, and resources but towards A.I. should go towards paying human developers. If A.I. is used, it should be used sparingly and consciously. 

Reflection:
This blog post was a lot harder to write than the last one. I’m not very good at writing these kinds of arguments and I don’t think my article lended itself well to being refuted. Otherwise, it was a really fun assignment and got me thinking about the source material differently.
