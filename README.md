# Getting Started
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Click the "fork" button in the top right.
3. Create using an ethics_fall2025 repo
4. Host with GitPages. Go to Settings>Pages>Branch. Click master from drop-down and Save
5. Enable URL. Go to Code > About > Gear icon > Website. Click 'Use your GitHub Pages website' and Save. This may take a minute to load.
6. Create Codespace. Go to Code dropdown > Codespaces > Create codespace on master. This takes a few minutes.
7. While you wait for Codespaces to load, find a profile picture. This can be a photo of yourself or any avatar you like. Save the file as profile.png and upload it to the images folder through GitHub's web interface. Note: You'll be replacing the existing profile.png file with your new profile.png file.
8. View _config.yml. Go to Basic Site Settings and update your name, url, and repo. Replace placeholder information with your own. Then scroll down to links and update to your liking.
9. View about.md in _pages. Update your name from the placeholder. This page will need to be updated with your information by the deadline in the course schedule.
