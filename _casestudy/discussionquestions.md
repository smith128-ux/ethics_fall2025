Now that you have read the case study, I’d like to come back to the questions presented at the beginning. Try to answer them to the best of your ability.

What are some other ways, other than the loot box, that gambling is incorporated into video gaming?

How else can developers regulate and mitigate the harms of gambling elements present in their games?

How might policymakers pass laws that regulate how loot boxes are implemented?

Does the regulation of gambling elements in video games fall on the shoulders of developers or are adults responsible for regulating themselves?
