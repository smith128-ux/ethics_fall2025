Parents have a reason for concern for loot boxes. Loot boxes tend to prey on young children and adolescents who may be unaware of the harms that gambling can bring. While most games nowadays contain some sort of loot box element, games rarely advertise these properly. Unlike in previous years, where concerned parents would have to buy a game physically for their kids and read all potential harms advertised on the box, games are now largely purchased through online stores. Most times, these games are free-to-play, not requiring a parent's approval whatsoever. In rare cases, children addicted to loot boxes may even steal their parent’s credit card information to gamble further.
