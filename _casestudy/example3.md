First person shooter (FPS) style games are well known for their use of weapon cases. These are boxes that contain different weapons/weapon skins with randomized probabilities. These games often have large economies, as well as a community of people who spend large amounts of money in an attempt to acquire rare items.

Examples: Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO), Team Fortress 2 (TF2)
