A loot box is an in-game item purchase consisting of a virtual ‘box’ that rewards in-game items to players based on mechanics of chance and probability. Similar in design to slot machines or Japan’s ‘Gacha’ capsules. Loot boxes are purchased with real money to obtain a chance of receiving virtual items of differing levels of rarity. Due to the low probability of obtaining rare items, and the natural stimulating nature of opening a loot box, players will have to purchase an indeterminable number of loot boxes to obtain any given desired item.

The purpose of this case study is to examine the ethical implications of incorporating loot boxes into video games, identify who the key stakeholders are, and discuss potential ways to combat these harms in the future.
