Cardpacks are elements featured in games and apps that center around a card-style like game. These games may allow you to buy cardpacks in-game, mirroring real world card packs where the contents of said packs are unknown. While paralleling real-world design, these card packs have the same characteristics of loot boxes.

Examples: Hearthstone, Clash Royale
