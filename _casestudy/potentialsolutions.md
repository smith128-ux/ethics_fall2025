This section aims to devise a few solutions that developers can put in place to prevent problem gambling and disordered gaming. 

Probability Disclosure:

This requires developers to clearly disclose odds and probabilities of obtaining certain items. This goes beyond indicators like ‘Common’, ‘Rare’, ‘Epic’, and so on. While knowing the probability in advance might not prevent all people from partaking in gambling activities, it acts as a possible deterrent for those unaware of how severe the unlikelyhood of obtaining certain in-game items are.

Transparency:

Gambling elements can often be invisible in games where gamers might not expect to see it. Transparency requires developers to clearly disclose the presence of gambling in their games and the harms they may present to vulnerable players. This could allow players to make informed decisions before committing to participating in these gambling elements.

Age-Based Safeguards:

Though games often come with an age-rating, these are often easily ignored by adults and adolescents alike. Age-based safeguards would require developers to implement some form of identification system to block any minors from accessing gambling elements. This wouldn’t prevent adult gamers with gambling issues, but could potentially prevent underage players from being exposed to gambling at an early age.

Implementing Purchasing Limits:

The issue many gamblers face is not knowing when to quit, or feeling pressured to continue playing until a desired outcome is reached. This behavior often leads to problem gambling and the many negatives that are associated with it. A limit on how many purchases could be made in a determined period of time, could potentially prevent someone from overspending on loot boxes.
