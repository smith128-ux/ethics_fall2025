It seems recently there's been an increase in elements in video games that seem like gambling real world money for trivial items. This is more commonly known as a ‘loot box’ or a ‘loot box system.’ It’s important going forward we clearly define what loot boxes are, how they are used, and where they’re usually found. Loot boxes act as a blurring of lines between video games and gambling activities. Loot boxes share several formal features with gambling.

While reading please consider the following questions:

What are some other ways, other than the loot box, that gambling is incorporated into video gaming?

How else can developers regulate and mitigate the harms of gambling elements present in their games?

How might policymakers pass laws that regulate how loot boxes are implemented?

Does the regulation of gambling elements in video games fall on the shoulders of developers or are adults responsible for regulating themselves?
